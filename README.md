# git_HandsOn_collab

##### The collaborative practical exercise can be seen in the following repository from Michelozz. 
* https://github.com/Michelozz/git_HandsOn/tree/task8practical

#### She invited me as a collaborator so I cloned the specific branch of her repository using the following script 
* git clone -b task8practical https://github.com/Michelozz/git_HandsOn 
#### and then I added, commited and pulled the changes I made.
